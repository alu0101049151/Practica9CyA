# Computability and algorithm, task 9: Chomsky Normal From of a Context Free Grammar.
### By Basilio GÃ³mez Navarro. November, 2019.

## The program:
 - The profram reads a ".gra" input file with the description of a Grammar
   and generates another ".gra" output file with the description of the same
   Grammar but in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).

## How to run the program:
 - The program name is "G2CNF", so, for run it:
   ./G2CNF [inputFile.gra] [ouputFile.gra]
 - If the program is executed  without parameters, it  will show a small
   message explaning how to run the program.
 - Also the "--help" parameter is aviable, so if you execute "./G2CNF --help"
   a unix-style help message will be displayed, detailing how to run the
   program correctly.
